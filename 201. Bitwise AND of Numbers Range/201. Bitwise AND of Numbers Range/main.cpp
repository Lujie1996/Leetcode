// E.g., m = 5 (0x101), n = 7(0x111), 5 and 7 are greater than base 0x100 which is 4, then this digit in result will be 1.
// m and n both reduce by 4, that is m = 1(0x01) and n = 3(0x11), and the base comes to 2. Not greater, so this digit in result is 0.
// Also, reduce them by 2 but ensure they are greater than 1, that is m = 0(0x0) and n = 1(0x1).
