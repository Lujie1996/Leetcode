 This is from BBS
 If current position i is an odd number, nums[i] >= nums[i-1]
 If current position i is an even number, nums[i] <= nums[i-1]
 Only iterate once.
 To prove this is right, say there are three numbers a, b, c, and a < b < c, when goes to b, it is fine since greater than a;
 When it goes to c, number at this position should be smaller than b, so swap b and c, that is a, c, b;
 After the swap, it's easy to think that the last two numbers are in right position(swap operation is to ensure this).
 What about the first two numbers? we have:
    1. a < b (we assume the string on the left side of current position is always correct),
    2. b < c (that is why we swap them).
 Therefore we prove that c > a, meaning that by swapping b and c, we are not corrupting the correctness of previous substring.
