/*
 when n is 0, it is clear that there is just one number 0.
 
 when n is 1, it is trivial that there are 10 numbers: 0,1,2...9.
 
 when n is 2, the range is [0, 99]. The total unique digits is divided to two part: just one digit or two digit.
 
 **dp[2]  = dp[1] + the combination with  two digits.**
 '0' could only be at unit digit. so when '0' is at unit digit, there are 9 kinds of. when there is no '0', there are 9 kinds of numbers at tens digit, and 8 kinds of numbers at unit digit. So the combination with two digits are: 9 + 9*8 is equal to
 
 9 * (1+8) = 9 * 9.
 when n is 3, the range is [0, 999]. The total unique digits is divided to two part: less than 3 digit or 3 digit.
 
 **dp[3]  = dp[2] + the combination with  3 digits.**
 '0' could only be at unit digit and ten's digit.
 
 When '0' is at unit digit, there are 9 * 8 kind of numbers(9 is the kind of numbers at hundred's digit, 8 is the kind of numbers at ten's digit);
 
 When '0' is at ten's digit, there are 9 * 8 kind of numbers(9 is the kind of numbers at hundred's digit, 8 is the kind of numbers at unit digit);
 
 When there is no '0', there are 9 * 8 * 7 kinds of numbers(9 is the kind of numbers at hundred's digit, 8 is the kind of numbers at ten's digit, 7 is the kind of numbers at unit digit).
 
 So there are:
 
 9 * 8  + 9 * 8 + 9 * 8 * 7  = 9 * 8 * (1 + 1 + 8 ) = 9 * 9 * 8
 kinds of combinations with three digits.
